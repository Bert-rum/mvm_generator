# mvm_generator
Multithreaded random mission generator for TF2 MvM gamemode.

Done in about ~800 lines of code and ~2500 lines of configuration.

Bots are added in config/bots.json, wavespawns (the groups of bots) are added in config/wavespawns.json, and missions are added in config/missions.

To generate the missions, you can run the executable with the options of 
- -m: which map to generate for
- -c: mission config to choose
